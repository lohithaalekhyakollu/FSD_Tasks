    <h1><b><center>Maha Kumbh 2025</center></b></h1><hr>
    <i>
    <p>The Maha Kumbh Mela (the festival of the sacred pitcher) is anchored in Hindu mythology. It is the world’s largest public gathering and collective act of faith. This congregation, primarily, includes Ascetics, Saints, Sadhus, Sadhvis, Kalpvasis and Pilgrims from all walks of life.

        Kumbh Mela, in Hinduism, is a religious pilgrimage that is celebrated four times over a course of 12 years. The geographical location of Kumbh Mela spans over four locations in India and the Mela site keeps rotating between one of the four pilgrimages on four sacred rivers as listed below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In Haridwar, Uttarakhand, on the banks of Ganges</li>
        <li>In Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh on the banks of Shipra</li>
        <li>In Nashik, Maharashtra on the banks of Godavari</li>
        <li>In Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the mythical invisible Sarasvati</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each site’s celebration is based on a distinct set of astrological positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the Jupiter. The celebrations occur at the exact moment when these positions are fully occupied, as it is considered to be the holiest time in Hinduism. The Kumbh Mela is an event that intrinsically encapsulates the science of astronomy, astrology, spirituality, ritualistic traditions, and socio-cultural customs and practices, making it extremely rich in knowledge.
Pilgrims to the Kumbh Mela come from all sections of the religion ranging from Sadhus (saints) and Naga Sadhus who practice ‘sadhana’ and keenly follow a strict path of spiritual discipline, to Hermits who leave their seclusion and come to visit the civilization only during the Kumbh Mela, to seekers of spirituality, and to common people practicing Hinduism.
During the Kumbh Mela, a number of ceremonies take place; the traditional procession of Akharas called ‘Peshwai’ on elephant backs, horses and chariots, the shining swords and rituals of Naga Sadhus during ‘Shahi Snaan’, and many other cultural activities that attract millions of pilgrims to attend the Kumbh Mela.
The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is going to be held at Prayagraj from January 13th, 2025 to February 26th, 2025. Below is the table mentioning the important dates of Maha Kumbh Mela.<br><br>
Tradition ascribes the Kumbh Mela’s origin to the 8th-century philosopher Shankara, who instituted regular gatherings of learned ascetics for discussion and debate.The founding myth of the Kumbh Mela—attributed to the Puranas (collections of myth and legend)—recounts how the gods and demons fought over the pot (kumbha) of amrit, the elixir of immortality produced by their joint churning of the milky ocean. This churning of the ocean is widely known as the Samudra Manthana or Sagara Manthana. To prevent the demons from winning the elixir, enchantress Mohini, an avatar of Lord Vishnu, seized the pot and carried it to heaven. As she did so, drops of the elixir fell on the Kumbh Mela’s four earthly sites (Haridwar, Nashik, Prayagraj, and Ujjain). At the climactic moment of each mela, it is believed that the rivers at those holy sites transform into vessels of that primordial nectar of immortality that conveys benefits to pilgrims.<br><br>
Another mention of the Kumbh Mela can be found in the accounts of renowned Chinese traveler Xuanzang, who documented the magnificence of the Kumbh Mela during his visit to India during 629–645 ce. His writings highlight King Harsha’s generous acts at the sacred confluence of rivers, where the king bestowed gifts and donations upon scholars and ascetics. King Harsha was also noted for organizing a grand quinquennial gathering at the holy confluence in Prayag (modern Prayagraj), during which he donated all his possessions.
The term kumbh comes from the Sanskrit word kumbha, or “pitcher,” but it is also the Sanskrit name for Aquarius, the sign of the zodiac in which Jupiter resides during the Haridwar mela.
