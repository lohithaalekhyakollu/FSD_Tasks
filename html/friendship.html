        Friendship is better than love
        We can loose our loved one's
        But friendship stays with us forever
        Friendship never ask who you are
        Friendship only says you are my friend
        Friendship never ask where you are from
        Friendship only says you are always there for me
        Friendship make us who we are
        It tells us the good and bad side of us
        Friendship always care
        Friendship listen to our voice
        Friendship listen to our heart
        Friendship never let u down
        Friendship draw you closer
        Even when u part ways
        Friendship never let go</pre></center></h1>
